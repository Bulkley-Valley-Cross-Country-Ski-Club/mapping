Outstanding Changes
x add dog icon to dog trails
x add lodge icon
x add viewpoint at valley map
- tidy and add legend to map for POI and trails grouped by colours
x add trail marker (square, diamond, circle) with colour to the names of the trails
x add all names to the map and if possible distances as this may be more relevant than numbers
	x not doing as unable to display many names when zoomed-out. Will use trail IDs with full names in legend for the full map, can use trail names in area maps as they're more zoomed-in
x smooth the sharp corners on the trails 14,15 and 22
	x decided this is not a good idea
x experiment with LiDAR / DEM data and provide some examples
x incorporate new .gpx tracks
	x updated Wild Dog
- create some map prototypes
	- include an area map prototype (should show full trail names instead of IDs)
- attempt to get trail junctions displaying without making the map too crowded
- experiment with different page sizes for printing, see how this effects the outcome
