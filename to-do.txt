Outstanding Changes
x add dog icon to dog trails
x add lodge icon
x add viewpoint at valley map
- tidy and add legend to map for POI and trails grouped by colours
x add trail marker (square, diamond, circle) with colour to the names of the trails
- add all names to the map and if possible distances as this may be more relevant than numbers
	- still trying to understand how to do this. Labels are set to not be scale-dependent but QGIS is clearly still showing / hiding them based on scale. As above, we may have to use trail numbers only as names will be too crowded
- smooth the sharp corners on the trails 14,15 and 22
	- why - if the data says there's a sharp corner why would we not trust it?
- experiment with LiDAR / DEM data and provide some examples
- incorporate new .gpx tracks
	- unclear what is expected here
